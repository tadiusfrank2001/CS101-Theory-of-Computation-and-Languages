-- listComp takes three inputs: the first is a function, the second a list and the third a predicate, 
-- and constructs a list by filtering the input list with the predicate then applying the function to the elements in the resultant list.

listComp::(a -> b) -> [a] -> (a -> Bool) -> [b]

listComp fun [] foo = []
listComp fun (h:t) foo = if foo h 
                     then (fun h) : listComp fun t foo
                     else listComp fun t foo

--getEmpl, which takes a list of Employee records, each of which has the following fields:
-- name which is a string, age which is an integer, and status which is of type Job and 
-- has a value of Managerial, Clerical, or Manual, as input, 
-- and returns the names of managerial employees over the age of 60.


data Job = Managerial | Clerical | Manual deriving Eq
data Employee = Employee{name::String, age::Integer, status::Job}

getEmpl :: [Employee] -> [String]

getEmpl [] = []
getEmpl (Employee{name = n, age = a, status = j}:t) = if (a > 60) && (j == Managerial)
                                                      then n : getEmpl t
