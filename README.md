# CS101-Theory-of-Computation-and-Languages


The course on the theory of computation involves coding in Haskell to investigate models of computation such as finite-state automata, Turing machines, and pushdown automata. It explores formal languages, including context-free grammars, and delves into key topics in computability, such as the halting problem and decidability. The course also examines the connections to real-world applications such as lexical analysis, parsing, writing interpreters, and compiling, bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementation. Through hands-on programming assignments and theoretical analysis, the course emphasizes the deep relationship between theory and practice in computation.
